100devs khanAcademy challenge

So, hello! This is my version of the 100devs khanAcademy homework! I want to make sure to keep a good overview of what I am doing, and learn to improve using git and github, so I will try to update both this README file, as well as the version history as usefully as possible! 

So, after completing this, I want to reflect: 
- I think I ABSOLUTELY used bad CSS to get where I am, and I definitely do not think it is perfect by any stretch of the imagination. There is a lot of overflow on code that could be optimized (with Flexbox), to make sure it works better, but for now, I am quite happy with the result as is. I am not happy with the logo not being centered, but I did not manage to get everything lined up better than that.
